# MapReduce: Fault-Tolerant System

## Overview
This project involves building a MapReduce system in C, focused on handling large-scale data processing across multiple workers with fault tolerance. The goal is to ensure reliable task distribution, fault recovery, and efficient data processing.

## Key Features
- **Distributed Task Processing**: Design a system to split work across multiple workers.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implement mechanisms to handle worker failures.
- **Efficiency**: Focus on scalability and reliability in large-scale data processing.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and set up the environment:
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd map-reduce
    ```

## Technologies Used
- **C** for system-level programming.
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)** for worker communication.

## Project Goals
- Implement MapReduce architecture with task distribution and fault recovery.
- Ensure system scalability and efficient resource management.
